# Shared data for a collaborative science
## Rat and mice brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging data repository


TIB-Lab is a dual laboratory specialized in both 1) image acquisition by Magnetic Resonance Imaging and 2) in data processing. We created this repository to share our acquired data, for computational laboratories to test their models in the different biological conditions we already acquired 

## dw-MRI data of inflammatory challenges in rats 

Our framework is based on stereotaxic injections of neurotoxins (saline contralaterally) in the rat hippocampus, followed by MRI acquisition, perfusion and histology. Specifically, we injected: 
i) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce microglia and astrocyte reactivity, 
ii) ibotenic acid to induce microglia reactivity, proliferation and neuronal death in the hippocampus, and axonal damage in the fimbria, i.e., its main projection to the prefrontal cortex, and 
iii) LPS animals pre-treated with PLX5622 to deplete microglia and isolate astrocyte. 
Then, the rats underwent an MRI protocol comprising a stimulated echo diffusion weighted MRI sequence (b=0, 2000 and 4000 s/mm2, diffusion times 15-60 ms).
